        <h2>Junior in Greenville, South Carolina</h2>
        
         <p>I am currently a junior at Bob Jones University studying Interior Architure and Design. I enjoy serving my fellow students as a dischipleship group leader in the dorms and as a life group leader for my society, the Zeta Tau Omega Seagulls.</p>
         <p>
            A small-town Southern girl, I enjoy meeting new people and being involved in the community, whether through church outreaches or neighborhood volunteer programs. I am active in my home church by participating in the music and children's ministries, as well as endeavoring to start a deaf ministry. 
         </p> 
         <p>
            In my leisure time, I enjoy being outdoors with my golden retriever, going on roadtrips, and spending time with family. My favorite rainy day activities include reading books and watching college football.
